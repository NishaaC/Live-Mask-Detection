**Face Mask Detection Using Deep Learning**
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect whether a person is wearing a mask in real-time. The model is trained on labeled datasets of masked and unmasked images, and the live detection is implemented using TensorFlow and OpenCV. The script processes live camera feed, predicts mask status, and displays the results with an overlay.
